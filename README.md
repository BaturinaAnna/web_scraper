# Web_scraper
The web scraper finds tickets on the airline's website https://www.airblue.com/ by the IATA codes of departure and destination points, departure date and arrival date (optional). If results are found for the specified route and dates, the application displays information about flights: all flight options, including the exact time of departure and arrival, duration of the flight and prices with indication of currency and class.
